			<h3>About Me</h3>

			<p>I'm a student at University of Toronto's 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/about_engsci/">Engineering Science </a>
				program. In one of our first physics lecture at the beginning <br>of first year, our professor presented us with
				a quotation from a previous of chair of Engineering Science: "Engineering Science is for the ‘Yes, but why?’ students."
				This nicely encapsulates how I approach learning and engineering - with a deep drive to understand the principles that 
				make the world tick.

				I am an Orthodox Jew, ...

			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>As an engineer, I've worked on several projects (including this website). 
			<br>Below are some school projects I found interesting:</p>

					<td><h4>Computer Science: Synonym Identifier</h4>
					For a school project, I developed a Python program that identifies the best synonym for a given word from a 
					list of choices. Depending on the similarity algorithm used, the program reached 75% accuracy.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>

					<td><h4>Design Project: Litter Collection</h4>
					As part of a design course, I worked with a group of 4 to design an improved apparatus for manual litter collection
					on the streets of Toronto. Focusing on durability and ergonomics, we redesigned the handle, added an extendable 
					pole, and developed a ingenious collection plate that allows user customization without causing wear.

			<h3>Reading</h3>
			<p>I spend a lot of my free time reading, particularly philosophy and Jewish texts.
			The latter includes Bible, Talmud, Jewish philosophy and other rabbinic and scholarly texts.
			My philosophical reading focuses on epistemology and logic. 
			
			<br><br>
			Other works I've read include Godel Escher Bach, etc.</p>
