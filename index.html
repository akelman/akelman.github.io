			<h3>About Me</h3>

			<p>I'm a student at University of Toronto's
				<a target="_blank" href="http://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/about_engsci/">Engineering Science</a>
				program. In one of our first physics lectures at the beginning of first year, our professor presented us with
				a quotation from a previous chair of Engineering Science: “Engineering Science is for the ‘Yes, but why?’ students.” This nicely encapsulates how I approach learning and engineering - with a deep drive to understand the principles that make the world tick.
				<br><br>
				I graduated from <a target="_blank" href="http://bastoronto.org/">Bnei Akiva Schools of Toronto</a> in 2013 as Valedictorian, vice president of student council and a member of the basketball team. I then spent two years studying in Israel at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.haretzion.org/about-us">Yeshivat Har Etzion</a>. In my spare time I enjoy jogging and reading philosophy.
				<br><br>
				I have experience with a variety of programming languages (including Python, C, PHP, JavaScript, HTML & CSS), and
				have taken a broad range of technical courses as part of the EngSci curriculum.

			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>As an engineer, I've worked on several projects (including this website).
			<br>Below are some school &amp; other projects that I've worked on:</p>

			<div class="example">
				<h4>VBM Data Mining</h4> <p class="year">2016</p>
				<p>I wrote a script to sort through thousands of (mainly) audio files, collect data on each file (speaker, date,
					etc), and create a csv file with the data. This allowed the Virtual Beit Midrash (VBM) to share these files
					with their community in an orderly way.
					<br>
					A simple html table with the generated data can be seen <a href="VBMdata.html">here</a>.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="example">
				<h4>Computer Science: Synonym Identifier</h4>
				<p>For a school project, I developed a Python program that identifies the best synonym for a given word from a
					list of choices. Depending on the similarity algorithm used, the program reached 75% accuracy.<p>
			</div>

			<div class="example">
				<h4>Design Project: Litter Collection</h4>
				<p>As part of a design course, I worked with a group of 4 to design an improved apparatus for manual litter collection
					on the streets of Toronto. Focusing on durability and ergonomics, we redesigned the handle, added an extendable
					pole, and developed an ingenious collection plate that allows user customization without causing wear.</p>

			<h3>Reading</h3>
			<p>I spend a lot of my free time reading, particularly philosophy and Jewish texts.
			The latter includes Bible, Talmud, Jewish philosophy and other rabbinic and scholarly texts.
			My philosophical reading focuses on epistemology and logic.<p>

			<div class="example">
				<h4>The Problems of Philosophy, Bertrand Russell</h4>
				<p class="subtitle">A proof for the existence of universals [“ideas”] (p100 of 170)</p>
				<p>As a matter of fact, if any one were anxious to deny altogether that there are such things as universals,
				we should find that we cannot strictly prove that there are such entities as qualities, i.e. the universals
				represented by adjectives and substantives, whereas we can prove that there must be relations, i.e. the sort
				of universals generally represented by verbs and prepositions. Let us take in illustration the universal
				whiteness. If we believe that there is such a universal, we shall say that things are white because they have
				the quality of whiteness. This view, however, was strenuously denied by Berkeley and Hume, who have been
				followed in this by later empiricists. The form which their denial took was to deny that there are such
				things as 'abstract ideas'. When we want to think of whiteness, they said, we form an image of some
				particular white thing, and reason concerning this particular, taking care not to deduce anything
				concerning it which we cannot see to be equally true of any other white thing. As an account of our
				actual mental processes, this is no doubt largely true. In geometry, for example, when we wish to prove
				something about all triangles, we draw a particular triangle and reason about it, taking care not to use
				any characteristic which it does not share with other triangles. The beginner, in order to avoid error,
				often finds it useful to draw several triangles, as unlike each other as possible, in order to make sure
				that his reasoning is equally applicable to all of them. But a difficulty emerges as soon as we ask
				ourselves how we know that a thing is white or a triangle. If we wish to avoid the universals whiteness
				and triangularity, we shall choose some particular patch of white or some particular triangle, and say
				that anything is white or a triangle if it has the right sort of resemblance to our chosen particular.
				But then the resemblance required will have to be a universal. Since there are many white things, the
				resemblance must hold between many pairs of particular white things; and this is the characteristic of
				a universal. It will be useless to say that there is a different resemblance for each pair, for then we
				shall have to say that these resemblances resemble each other, and thus at last we shall be forced to
				admit resemblance as a universal. The relation of resemblance, therefore, must be a true universal. And
				having been forced to admit this universal, we find that it is no longer worth while to invent difficult
				and unplausible theories to avoid the admission of such universals as whiteness and triangularity.</p>
