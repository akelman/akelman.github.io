			<h3>About Me</h3>

			<p>I'm a student at University of Toronto's 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/about_engsci/">Engineering Science </a>
				program. In one of our first physics lecture at the beginning of first year, our professor presented us with
				a quotation from a previous of chair of Engineering Science: "Engineering Science is for the ‘Yes, but why?’ students."
				This nicely encapsulates how I approach learning and engineering - with a deep drive to understand the principles that 
				make the world tick.

			<p>What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
			the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled 
			it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
			remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem 
			Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
